The aim is to create a simple password manager that can do the following:
1. Store all passwords locally
2. Store passwords relatively securely with encrpytion techniques
3. Make it easy for users to store all their passwords in a single place

What I hope to learn by engaging in this exercise is:
1. PyQt6 : GUI using python
2. Cryptography techniques
3. Database Management
