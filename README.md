# passwordManager
This is something I am building over the weekend as a fun project. 

The aim is to create a simple password manager that can do the following:
1) Store all passwords locally
2) Store passwords relatively securely with encrpytion techniques
3) Make it easy for users to store all their passwords in a single place

What I hope to learn by engaging in this exercise is:
1) PyQt6 : GUI using python
2) Basic Cryptography techniques
3) How to handle essential data
